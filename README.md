# Linear_Regression_Beer_Consumption

The aim of this project is to estimate a Machine Learning model using the Linear Regression technique to demonstrate the impact of the variables provided in this dataset on beer consumption (Y). 
At the end of the project we will have a predictive model for average beer consumption according to the inputs of a set of variables (X's).

The data (sample) was collected in S찾o Paulo - Brazil, in a university area, where there are some parties with groups of students aged 18 to 28 (average).

Data:
data - Date
temp_media - Average temperature (째C)
temp_min - Minimum temperature (째C)
temp_max - Maximum temperature (째C)
chuva - Precipitation (mm)
fds - Weekend (1 = Yes; 0 = No)
consumo - Beer consumption (liters)
